# ANALYTICALPROCESSCONTROL-SIEMENS-DOCUMENTATION
This is a digital twinning project. It involves creating a virtual machine that runs cocurrently with a physical machine.
A 3D model of the machine was created using Siemens NX software. signals were added tothe model to show sensors and actuators of the machine.
A ladder PLC program was used to program the sensors and actuators of the machine.
A virtual assistant for the machine was also added. It was coded using python and accepts and returns oral commands and can recognize users using face recognition.
The software were connected by means of virtual commisioning using OPCUA Server and Client.
